# React-Exercise-Portfolio

## This was my final project for my first React class. It was my first attempt at making a portfolio site using the MUI library.

The assignment was to build a website with a form that could add, edit and delete a .json file. The site also had to have a page that displayed all the entries from the .json file in a card layout. 
I made a mock portfolio with an admin page that used a form to add, edit and delete projects:

and a projects page to display each project in a card format:
